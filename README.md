# Dotfiles
Various configuration files and scripts, mainly for GNU/Linux systems. [See a preview of ncmpcpp](http://hdni.github.io/rice/assets/ncmpcpp.png).

## Notes
* Some of these files may need editing to be usable on your system.
* The vim color scheme should be placed in `/usr/share/vim/vim73/colors` under any name you choose, and this name has to be set in your .vimrc. For example, mine is named `custom.vim`.
* The Powerline color scheme should be placed in `~/.vim/bundle/vim-powerline/autoload/Powerline/Colorschemes`, with the same procedure as above.
* The infinality settings file has to be in `/etc/profile.d`.
* The oh-my-zsh theme has to be in `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`, and then set in your .zshrc.
